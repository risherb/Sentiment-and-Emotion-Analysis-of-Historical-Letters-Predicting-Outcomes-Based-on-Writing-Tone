I explored a dataset of World War I letters, analyzing emotions like love, fear, and sadness in both French and English. Using natural language processing, I assessed the sentiment and built a predictive model to estimate the emotional tone based on writing style. This project sharpened my skills in text analysis and machine learning.

# üåç **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis of World War I Letters**

Welcome to the **World War I Letters Sentiment Analysis** project! This repository contains code and analysis of letters written during World War I, where I applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) to explore the emotions and sentiments behind these historical documents. The goal? To understand how the tone of these letters (love, fear, sadness, etc.) reflected the emotional states of soldiers during the war.

## üßê **What Did I Do?**

1. **Sentiment and Emotion Analysis**: I used NLP techniques to analyze the emotional tone in French and English letters.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned, tokenized, and prepared the text for analysis.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Built a model to predict the emotional tone based on writing style.
4. **Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations to compare emotions and sentiment by language and time.
