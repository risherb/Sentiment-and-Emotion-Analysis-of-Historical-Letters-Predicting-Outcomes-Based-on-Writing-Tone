# Sentiment-and-Emotion-Analysis-of-Historical-Letters-Predicting-Outcomes-Based-on-Writing-Tone
I explored a dataset of World War I letters, analyzing emotions like love, fear, and sadness in both French and English. Using natural language processing, I assessed the sentiment and built a predictive model to estimate the emotional tone based on writing style. This project sharpened my skills in text analysis and machine learning.
